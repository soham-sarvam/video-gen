# 🎬 VideoAgent Director

Turn any creative idea into a shot-by-shot production. The Director skill plans a storyboard from your concept and generates each shot's assets — reference image, video clip, and audio — automatically.

> One prompt. A complete storyboard. All assets generated.

---

## What It Does

1. **Analyzes your brief** — extracts format, tone, key shots
2. **Plans the storyboard** — breaks the concept into 4–8 shots with clear visual and audio direction
3. **Executes shot by shot** — for each shot:
   - Generates a **reference frame** (image)
   - Uses it to create a **video clip** (image-to-video for visual consistency)
   - Adds **audio** — music, SFX, or voiceover
4. **Delivers the production** — a formatted storyboard with all asset URLs

## Quick Start

Just describe what you want in plain language:

> "Make a 30-second brand video for a minimalist coffee brand. Instagram vertical format."

> "Create a short film teaser for a sci-fi story about a lone astronaut discovering a signal from Earth."

> "Produce a product launch reel for a smartwatch. 15 seconds, energetic."

No prompts to write, no model to pick. The Director handles everything and delivers the final assets.
